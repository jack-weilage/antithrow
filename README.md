# antithrow

A TypeScript ecosystem for Rust-style `Result<T, E>` error handling without exceptions.

`antithrow` helps you model failure paths explicitly so error handling is type-safe, composable,
and visible at compile time.

- Keep the happy path readable while still handling failures early.
- Encode all failure variants in the type system.
- Compose sync and async pipelines with the same mental model.
- Interoperate with throw-based code via `Result.try(...)` and `ResultAsync.try(...)`.

## Packages

- [`antithrow`](./packages/antithrow) - Core `Result`, `ResultAsync`, and `chain` utilities.
